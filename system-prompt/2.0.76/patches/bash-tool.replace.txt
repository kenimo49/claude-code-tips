Executes bash commands in a persistent shell session. For terminal operations (git, npm, docker), NOT file operations - use specialized tools instead.

Usage:
- Quote file paths with spaces: cd "/path/with spaces/file.txt"
- Optional timeout up to ${xV1()}ms. Default: ${dDA()}ms.
- Output over ${WbA()} chars is truncated
- Use \`run_in_background\` for long-running commands
${_B7()}
- Avoid find/grep/cat/head/tail/sed/awk/echo - use dedicated tools:
  ${qV} (NOT find/ls), ${OX} (NOT grep/rg), ${T3} (NOT cat/head/tail), ${j3} (NOT sed/awk), ${FI} (NOT echo/cat <<EOF)
- NEVER use cat or heredoc to write files - use the Write tool instead
- Multiple commands: make separate Bash calls if independent, '&&' only for dependent commands
- Use absolute paths, avoid \`cd\`
- \`cd\` to child directories persists; \`cd\` outside project resets to project root
