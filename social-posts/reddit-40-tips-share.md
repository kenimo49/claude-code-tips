# Created a GitHub repo with 40+ tips for using Claude Code that I've learned over the past 10 months

I've been working on this repo where I've been gathering all the tips I learned about using Claude Code effectively over the past 10 months. I wanted to share it with you and also thank you for starring it if you already have. The response from this community has been amazing and I'm glad I'm able to contribute back.

I actually shared it once in this community with [all the tips listed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1pfxqlb/30_claude_code_tips_from_basics_to_advanced/) but the post was removed by Reddit for some reason. Hopefully this one will go through: https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips
